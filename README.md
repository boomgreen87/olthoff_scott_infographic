# Infographic - Scott Olthoff

### Authors
Scott Olthoff

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage for the infographic that we designed in MMED-3038.

### Description
The interactive site is to be designed mobile first and should have interactive and/or animated elements. The displayed information should be pulled from a database using AJAX calls.

My infographic is on Wayne Gretzky's statistics. My infographic allows users to choose a team by clicking on a logo and Gretzky's statistics for that team will appear.
